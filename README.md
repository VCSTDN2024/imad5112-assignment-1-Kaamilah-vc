## Project Overview

The **On the Go Meal** is a mobile application developed to suggest meals based on the time of day. The app allows the user to input the time of day (morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid-afternoon,dinner,after-dinner) and get meal suggestions. This application was developed using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**.

The main objective of the application is to give users easy food options according to their tastes and the time of day.


## App Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of the On The Go Meal App is to help users find meal ideas for different times of the day. Whether it’s morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid-afternoon, dinner, after-dinner the app offers a quick and easy way to decide what to eat.

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: The app indicates meals taking into account the time of day entered by the user.
- Feature 2: Has the reset button that the user will use to reset the displayed meal suggestions with a reset button.
  
These features aim to provide that the app work based on the functions you click to get the suggestion information you want 


# Design Considerations

The design of the **On the GO Meal** was based on the following key considerations :

**User Experience (UX)**:

- The app was created with the intention of offering a smooth and easy-to-use experience. 
- To reduce confusion, clear and simple directions were given at every stage, and all required actions are readily available with a few touches.

**Responsiveness**:
- The application was designed to function well across a variety of screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring that it would work on devices from tablets to smartphones.

**Simplicity**:
- The app's layout takes a minimalist approach, highlighting only the most important elements without consuming the user with unnecessary choices.

 **Performance**:
 - The app is optimized to run smoothly even on low-end devices, ensuring fast load times and smooth transitions between screens.
 - The app uses minimal system resources, providing fast response times and low battery usage.

 GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

 Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

**Challenge 1**:There were a few cases were buttons or text fields did not function as intended because I had trouble making sure that the UI components  were correctly linked to their appropriate XML elements in the Kotlin code.

 **Solution**: I checked that the findViewById references matched the matching IDs in the XML layout file by checking them multiple times.

 From this challenge I learned that testing and double-checking references are essential when linking UI components to the code, especially when working with view elements in Android.


## Future Enhancements
 
**Feature 1**: Allow users to customise their favourite foods.

**Feature 2**: Add the app's multilingual support.

**Feature 3**: Include voice input so that people can say their food preferences without typing anything.
